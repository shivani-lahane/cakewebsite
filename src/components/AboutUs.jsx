                            Our journey began with one humble shop in Fort, Mumbai and grew to over one thousand locations throughout India under the inspiring vision of our founder, Hussein Khorakiwala in the early 1956. Since then, our family has combined their years of experience with the vision of a community of collaborative shop owners, suppliers and other partners working together to create a brand name in the market to grow their business to what it is today.

                            In order to achieve this, the family offers franchises to budding entrepreneurs & distributors partnering with them to ensure success and excellence.
